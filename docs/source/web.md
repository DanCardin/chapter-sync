# Web

An obvious extension to the tool, given that it's recording everything to a
database would be a web UI to use to manage series/perform actions.

`chapter-sync web` will start a web service which can be used to manage the
database and/or view the data.

See the [installation](./installation.md) docs for information on running the
web service in docker.
